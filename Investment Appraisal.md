### ARR 
% return on investment.

ARR = Average Annual Return / investment

|       Year        | Net Cash Flow  | Discount Factor |
|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
|0                  |-$500,000       |1                |
|1                  | $100,000       |0.952            |
|2                  | $300,000       |0.907            |
|3                  | $400,000       |0.864            |

ARR = $100,000 / $500,000 x 100 = 20%

### NPV
multiplying the discount factors by the net cash flows to give NPV for each year, then sum then up to give the total project return.

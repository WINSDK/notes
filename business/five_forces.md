## Why do airlines make so little profit (and such big losses)

* High barrier to entry
  - Planes are expensive and time-consuming to manufacture
  - Pilots have high wages and have to be trained
  - Large amount of government regulations (~1.5b a year for large airlines)
* Bargaining power of suppliers
  - Airlines are highly dependent on fuel prices
  - Many airports will charge high fees for landing and the use of facilities
* Bargaining power of buyers
  - As competition is high, buyers will easily leave depending on
  pricing and service
* Extremely high fixed costs
  - Maintenance is common and expensive
  - Large airplanes hanger's have to be rented
  - Number of personnel required for check-in, etc is high

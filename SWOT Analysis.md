SWOT analysis helps a business assess it's competitive strength and the
nature of it's external environment. It's split up into two parts:
* Internal to a business
  - Strengths
  - Weaknesses
* External to a business
  - Opportunities
  - Threats

### Assessing strengths and weaknesses
* Competitive advantages
* Role for benchmarking
* Key performance indicators

### Examples of evidence of strengths and weaknesses
* Market share
* Profitability (operating profit margin)
* Brand recognition and loyalty
* Market capitalization (value and growth)
* Reputation for quality

### Evaluating strengths and weaknesses
* Important to focus only on the most important
* Is the judgment made reliable? (independent)
* How sustainable are the strengths?
* Can weaknesses be overcome? How?

### Assessing opportunities and threats
* How to take advantage of opportunities
* How to protect against threats
* Role of risk management and contingency planning

A business should thrive to turn it's weaknesses into strengths, 
it's threats into opportunities and use those opportunities to achieve 
greater strength. However it's threats may eventually become weaknesses

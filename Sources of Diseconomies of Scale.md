# Internal Communication
The exchange of messages and the flow of information within a business. Businesses grow too quickly and inefficiencies come in effect.
* Layers in the management structure grow
* Distortion of communication occurs (misunderstandings and incorrect interpretations)
* Resource allocation disagreements

### A tall hierarchical structure
Channels of communications become **slow**, misunderstandings and frictions can occur amongst employees with potential **reduced productivity**.

### Poor communication 
Staff can be **informed easily** on updates within the organization, IT can be extremely helpful and businesses can send a singular email to thousands of employees if needed.  However misunderstandings can happen and **friction** may occur as information has to go through *many individuals*. IT systems may also fail resulting in mass panic.

### Resource spending
Departments may hide information from each other for their own benefits. Figures might be **misconstrued** or **hidden** completely to receive *unfair* portions of resources. Two departments could both be working on the same task without each others knowledge. With a lack of communication and large distances between these conglomerates departments will spend time **repeating tasks** often.

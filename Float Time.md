# Float time
In [project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management "Project management"), **float** or **slack** is the amount of time that a task in a [project network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_network "Project network") can be delayed without causing a delay to:
* subsequent tasks 
* project completion date

### Total float time
Can be calculated by summing all float values and can represent schedule flexibility. Total float time can also be calculated by subtracting the **earliest finish time** from the **latest finish time**.

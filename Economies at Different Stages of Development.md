# Characteristics of Economies at Different Stages of Development

There is a vast difference in prosperity and welfare between countries, only a minority of countries have access to good healthcare, education, housing and access to high-quality food. The people in these countries will also have *disposable income* to spend on non-essential items such as holidays, entertainment and leisure activities.

### Developed Economies
Countries like the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia where most people experience a high standard of living. They have the following characteristics:

* **High Income levels**
    A relatively high income of around $12500 per capita
    as stated by the World Bank.
* **High literacy rate**
    That the majority of people can read and write
    close to 100% is necessary to be a developed 
* **High life expectancy**
    Where people are expected to live for over 60 years
    a high life expectancy is 80+ as seen in countries like japan (85 years)
* **Good infrastructure**
    A country where most people have access to schools, colleges, healthcare
    and varying degrees of welfare. A place with railway networks, motorways,
    sewerage systems, electric grids and mobile communcation systems.
* **Highly industrialized**
    Developed countries tent to not rely on the *primary sector* and rely much
    more heavily on the *tertiary sector*. E.g. France has nearly 80% of
    it's population employed in the *tertiary sector* with australia at around 70%.
* **low levels of unemployment**
    Enough labor *opportunities* for people. Laws that protect employees from
    being *exploited* and working conditions that are *clean and safe*; this
    isn't always consistent however as some developed countries 
    have seen unemployment rise to almost 22% in countries such as greece. 

### Developing Economies
A majority of countries, more than 200 countries are developing or have less-developed economies. Most are in the *southern hemisphere* where climate conditions are often rough, but they do share the same problems as developed economies but suffer through them. E.g. a low education level in the many countries that *lack the resources* to maintain higher-level schools.

They do however have **high population growth**, the rate of birth in many developed countries hovers around 2 kids a family whilst countries like the *DRC* (Democratic Republic of Congo) have more than 3 times the birth rate (6.3 kids a family).

### Emerging Economies
An economy with *rapid economic growth* (usually measured by their [[GDP per capita]]). Due to the speed of their growth there's a lot of opportunity and risk, compared to a mature market; it's easy for one of these economies to rapidly decline as they are *unstable* with rampid speculation.

Emerging economies display a lot of the characteristics of [[#Developed Economies]] especially when it comes to income levels and unemployment however they often lack the long term investments of good infrastructure and life expectancy.

### Main elements of competition policy
* Anti-trust & cartels
  - Elimination of agreements that restrict competition including 
  price fixing by firms who hold a dominant market position
* Market liberalization
  - Introducing competition in previously monopolistic sectors such as energy supply, retail banking, postal services, mobile telecommunications and air transport
* State aid control
  - Policy analyses state aid measures such as airline subsidies
  to ensure that such measures do not distort competition in the single market
* Merger contol
  - Investigation of mergers and take-overs between firms which could result
  in them dominating the market

### Examples of anti-competitive behavior

* Predatory pricing & limit pricing
* Charging excessively high prices

* Patent misuse
* Protectionist policies limiting overseas trade

### What do the competition regulators actually do?
* **monitor and regulate prices**: Regulators aim to ensure that companies
  do not exploit their monopoly power by charging excessive prices
* **Standards of customer services**: Companies that fail to meet specific
  services standards can be fined or have their 
  franchise / license taken away
* **Open up markets**: Encourage competition by removing or lowering the 
  barrier of entry. This might be achieved by forcing the dominant firm in the 
  industry to allow others to use it's infrastructure network.

If you have more than 50% of the market share, you are considered dominated.

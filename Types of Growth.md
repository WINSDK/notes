## Joint venture
A separate business entity created by two or more parties, 
involving shared ownership, returns and risks

### Potential Benefits of a joint venture
* Benefits from each other's expertise and resources
  - e.g market knowledge, customer base, distribution
  channels, R&D expertise
* Each partner might have the option to acquire in the future
  the JV business based on agreed terms if it proves successful
* Reduces the risk of a growth strategy
  particularly if it involves entering a new market or diversification

## Takeover
Involves one business acquiring control of another business

### Reasons for takeovers
* Increase market share
* Acquire new skills
* Access to economics of scales
* Secure better distribution
* Acquire intangible assets (brands, patents, trade marks)
* Spread risk by diversification

#### Additional reasons for takeovers
* Overcome barriers to entry to target markets
* Defend itself against a takeover threat
* Enter new segments of an existing market
* To elimate competition

### Drawbacks of takeovers
* High costs involved
* Problems of valuation
* Upset customers and suppliers
* Change/Update in management
* Resistance from employees

#### Additional Drawbacks of takeovers
* Non-existent cost savings
* Incompatibility of management styles, structures and culture
* Questionable motives
* High failure rate

### Reasons a takeover fails
* Price paid for takeover was too high
* Takeover was mishandled
* Business culture incompatible between businesses
* Loss of employees and customers post acquisition
* Competitors take the opportunity to gain market share
* Poor communication, particularly with management, employees
  or other stakeholders of the business

## Types and direction of integration
|**forward + vertical**        |Acquiring a business further up in the supply chain <br> e.g manufacturer buys a distributor|
|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|**backward + vertical**       |Acquiring a business operating earlier <br> in the supply chain, e.g. retailer buys wholesaler|
|**horizontal**                |Acquiring a business at the same stage of the supply chain <br> e.g. a manufacturer buys a competitor|
|**conglomerate**              |Where the acquisition has no clear connection <br> to the business buying it|

## Integration

### Horizontal integration
When a business purchases/merges with it's direct competitors or
others in the same market.

1. Achieve economics of scales
2. Savings from the potential sharing of supplier and more (rationalization)
3. Potential to increase revenue
4. Wider range of products, e.g. diversification
5. Reduces competition by removing key rivals,
   might increase market share and pricing power
6. Buying an existing and well known brand can be cheaper 
   than organically growing a brand. This can make
   the barrier-to-entry higher for competitors

### Vertical integration
When a business purchases/merges with it's suppliers.

1. Enables a business to capture a greater share of the profit
   on each sale
2. Secures important sources of supply or distribution
3. Create a barrier to entry to potential new competitors
4. Gain greater insight into customer needs and
   wants at each stage of the supply chain
